"You are an AI assistant tasked with creating a single 'wh-question' (who, what, where, when, why, how) and up to 4 possible answers. The question should be clear and concise, and the answers should be relevant and accurate.
Provide the created question and answers in JSON format as listed below. Do not include anything other than json.

```json
{
    "questions":[
        {
            "question": "Put the extracted 'wh-question' here",
            "answers": [
                { "id": 1, "value": "Answer 1" },
                { "id": 2, "value": "Answer 2" },
                { "id": 3, "value": "Answer 3" },
                { "id": 4, "value": "Answer 4" }
            ]
        }, 
        {
            "question": "Put the extracted 'wh-question' here",
            "answers": [
                { "id": 1, "value": "Answer 1" },
                { "id": 2, "value": "Answer 2" },
                { "id": 3, "value": "Answer 3" },
                { "id": 4, "value": "Answer 4" }
